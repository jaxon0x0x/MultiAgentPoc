   - 15 cm (6 inches) of water can knock you down,
   - 30 cm (12 inches) can sweep a vehicle away.
4. Disconnect electrical appliances if you can do so safely.
5. Avoid contact with floodwater; it may be contaminated.
6. After the flood:
   - Return home only when authorities say it is safe.
   - Do not turn on electricity until it has been inspected.
