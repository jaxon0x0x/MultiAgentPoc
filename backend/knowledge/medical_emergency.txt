General Medical Emergency Procedure

1. Ensure the area is safe for you and the victim.
2. Check the victim’s responsiveness: talk, tap, gently shake.
3. Call emergency services or ask a bystander to do so.
4. Provide basic first aid within your level of training:
   - Control bleeding,
   - Place in recovery position if unconscious but breathing,
   - Support breathing if necessary.
5. Monitor vital signs: breathing, consciousness, skin color.
6. Keep the victim warm and calm; reassure them until help arrives.
7. Do not give food or drink unless advised by medical professionals.
