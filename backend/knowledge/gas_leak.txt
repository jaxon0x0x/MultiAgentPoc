Gas Leak Procedure

1. If you smell gas or suspect a gas leak:
   - Do not use electrical switches, phones, or anything that can cause a spark.
   - Do not light matches or use open flames.
2. Open doors and windows to ventilate the area if it is safe.
3. Evacuate the building immediately.
4. From a safe location outside, call gas emergency services or the fire department.
5. Do not re-enter the building until it has been inspected and declared safe.
