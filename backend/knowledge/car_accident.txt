Car Accident Procedure

1. Ensure your own safety first (switch on hazard lights, wear a reflective vest if available).
2. Call emergency services immediately and provide location and basic details.
3. Check victims for consciousness, breathing, and severe bleeding.
4. Do not move injured persons unless there is an immediate danger (fire, explosion, traffic).
5. If trained, provide first aid: control bleeding, support breathing, keep the person warm.
6. Secure the crash site using warning triangles or other signals.
7. Wait for emergency responders and follow their instructions.
