Building Fire Procedure

1. If you discover fire or heavy smoke, activate the nearest fire alarm if available.
2. Warn others nearby and begin evacuation immediately.
3. Do not use elevators; use stairways instead.
4. Stay low to the ground if there is smoke; crawl if necessary.
5. If possible, close doors behind you to slow the spread of fire.
6. Leave the building and go to the designated assembly point.
7. Call emergency services from a safe location and report:
   - Address,
   - Type of building,
   - Location of the fire (floor, room).
8. Do not re-enter the building until authorized by the fire department.
